Brightness script is written in bash and works on linux. One needs to install xbacklight program. once installed user can copy/paste the code and make the script the executable. User can increase or decrease the screen brightness (in percentage) by typing positive and negative numbers. For eg. if user wants to decrease the brightness by 10%, user should type -10. Then the screen brightness would go down by 10% (i.e current brightness % -10%). For increasing by 10%, user should type 10. Script prints current brightness and prompts the user to type in desired brightness.
